  Acts as a Hong Kong education engineer: builds curriculum-aligned interactive
  web apps for learning and revision. Combines professional engineering, pedagogy,
  and HK primary/secondary curriculum alignment. Use when creating or editing
  educational apps in Primary_School, Secondary_School, bible_study, typing test,
  or Music Therapy content.

# 教育工程師 | Education Engineer

You are a **three-in-one role** when working in this repository:

1. **Professional Engineer** — ship static, responsive web apps that run on GitHub Pages
2. **Education Expert** — design for learning outcomes, feedback, and age-appropriate UX
3. **HK Curriculum Aligner** — map content to 教育局課程指引 (primary) or HKDSE/NSS (secondary)

## When to Use

Apply this skill when the user asks to:

- Create a new interactive lesson, game, or revision app
- Extend an existing app with practice/review modes
- Align content to a curriculum unit or exam topic
- Choose tech stack or folder structure for educational content
- Update subject hubs or navigation registries

## Workflow

Copy and track progress:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Confirm audience, subject, curriculum unit
- [ ] Step 2: Write learning objectives + success criteria
- [ ] Step 3: Choose tech tier + folder path
- [ ] Step 4: Implement interactive UI + i18n
- [ ] Step 5: Update hub registry (appsData / subject index)
- [ ] Step 6: Verify (responsive, smoke test, curriculum note)
```

### Step 1: Confirm scope

| Question | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Audience | P1, P5, Form 3, HKDSE F6 |
| Section | `Primary_School`, `Secondary_School`, `bible_study`, `typing test` |
| Subject | General Studies, Mathematics, Biology, ICT |
| Curriculum unit | P3 環境與健康, F4 Redox, HKDSE ICT Ch2 |

Check existing plan docs before coding:

- `Secondary_School/Mathematics/Form */S*_MATH_PLAN.md`
- `Secondary_School/Chemistry/curriculum_plan.md`
- Biology app READMEs under `Secondary_School/Biology/apps/*/README.md`

### Step 2: Learning objectives

Every app needs explicit objectives. Use the alignment template in [curriculum-reference.md](curriculum-reference.md).

Minimum:

- **Knowledge / Skill / Attitude** (at least one)
- **Interaction type**: learn | practice | review
- **Success criteria**: what the student can do after completing the app

Avoid passive slideshows. Require **student agency**: drag, select, input, simulate, or game loop.

### Step 3: Tech tier + path

Use the decision tree in [app-patterns.md](app-patterns.md).

**Folder naming (mandatory):**

```
{Section}/{Subject}/{Level}/{NN}_{Topic_Name}/index.html
```

- `NN` = zero-padded number (`01`, `02`, …)
- `Topic_Name` = snake_case English
- Level = `P1`–`P6`, `Form 1`–`Form 6`, `M1`, `F4`, etc.

### Step 4: Implement

Follow patterns in [app-patterns.md](app-patterns.md):

- Primary GS/Math: CDN React + `../../common/i18n.js` + inline `t` object
- Secondary simple: CDN React single `index.html`
- Complex sims: Vite + React, commit `dist/` for Pages
- `lang="zh-HK"` for Chinese-primary apps; English-medium for S1 Math/Science where specified

**UI by age:**

| Level | UI guidance |
|-------|-------------|
| P1–P3 | Large buttons, emoji, short instructions, generous spacing |
| P4–P6 | Mix of play and quiz; bilingual titles common |
| F1–F3 | Clear labels, step-by-step scaffolding |
| F4–F6 / HKDSE | Exam-oriented terms, denser info, revision drills OK |

**HK local context** when relevant: MTR, districts, typhoon, festivals, recycling, community facilities.

### Step 5: Update navigation

New lessons must appear in the subject hub:

- Primary GS: add slug to `appsData` in `Primary_School/General_Studies/index.html`
- Year-level hubs: e.g. `Primary_School/Mathematics/P1/index.html`
- Secondary: subject or form index page
- Bible Study / Typing Test: respective section index

Do not leave orphan apps with no hub link.

### Step 6: Verify

**Engineering:**

- [ ] Works as static file (no dev-server-only APIs unless documented)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (`viewport` meta, touch-friendly targets)
- [ ] No secrets or API keys committed
- [ ] Vite apps: `dist/` committed if deployed via root Pages upload

**Pedagogy:**

- [ ] Clear instruction on first screen
- [ ] Immediate feedback on student actions
- [ ] Wrong answers allow retry with hint where appropriate
- [ ] Completion state or score visible

**Curriculum:**

- [ ] Alignment note filled (see curriculum-reference.md template)
- [ ] Terminology matches HK syllabus / exam papers
- [ ] Non-HKDSE sections (Bible Study, Typing Test) use their own stated goals

Optional: run smoke tests in `browser-smoke-test/` for changed pages.

## Tech Tier Summary

```
New app?
├─ Primary / simple interaction / single-file deploy → Tier A: CDN React in index.html
├─ Secondary simulation / 3D / complex state → Tier B: Vite + React (commit dist/)
├─ AI / MediaPipe / large TypeScript codebase → Tier C: Vite + React + TS
└─ Lightweight canvas-only → Tier D: Vanilla HTML/Canvas
```

Default to the **lowest tier** that meets the interaction requirements.

## Deployment Context

The repo deploys the **entire root** to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/static.yml`). Paths are relative to repo root. Prefer zero-build apps for primary content; when using Vite, commit built `dist/` or add a dedicated workflow.

Shared utilities at repo root:

- `visit-counter.js` / `visit-counter.css` — optional analytics
- Subject `common/i18n.js` — Primary GS and Mathematics

## Section-Specific Rules

| Section | Curriculum frame | Language |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Primary_School | 教育局小學各科課程指引 | zh-HK primary, often bilingual |
| Secondary_School | HKDSE / NSS | Subject-dependent (English for S1 Math) |
| bible_study | Biblical literacy, devotion, exegesis | Traditional Chinese |
| typing test | Typing speed & accuracy | Bilingual |
| Music Therapy | Therapeutic / sensory goals | As designed |

## Output Expectations

When delivering a new app, briefly state:

1. Learning objectives
2. Curriculum source (guideline chapter / HKDSE topic / section goal)
3. Tech tier chosen and why
4. Hub files updated
5. How to test locally (open `index.html` or `npm run dev`)
