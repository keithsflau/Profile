# Mechanisms of Substance Movement - HKDSE Biology App

A high-fidelity interactive simulation of cell membrane transport mechanisms, designed for HKDSE Biology students.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas Simulation**: Visualizes Brownian motion and membrane interactions.
- **4 Learning Modes**:
  - **Simple Diffusion**: O2 diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer.
  - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Glucose transport via Channel Proteins.
  - **Osmosis**: Water movement via Aquaporins with solute concentration controls.
  - **Active Transport**: Sodium-Potassium pump simulation requiring ATP (Interactive).
- **Real-Time Data**: Line chart visualization of concentration changes over time.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean UI with Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 3
- HTML5 Canvas API
- Recharts
- Lucide React Icons
